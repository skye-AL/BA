\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
In view of the future stringent emissions limitations, new control
algorithms have to be designed. For optimization and testing of such
control algorithms, fast engine models are necessary. Based on
measurement data of an HD and an HSDI diesel engine, a mean-value
model of the whole engine has to be derived. This model has to be
easy to calibrate on various engines. It should be implemented in
the Simulink environment. The implemented blocks should be held as
general as possible so they can be used for different applications
(Simulink Engine Library).

\section{Goals}\label{sec:goals}
The goal of this thesis is not to build totally new models for the
different subsystems of a modern Diesel engine. So most model
approaches for the different subsystems are taken from literature.
The sources are referred at the corresponding places. A meaningfull 
\section{Procedure}\label{sec:procedure}
First the model approaches for the different subsystems are
presented.
